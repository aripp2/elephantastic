# PuppyLove

### Created By: Amy Rippeto student at Turing School of Software & Design

## Objective

I was tasked with finding an api and building an application utilizing it. I love all animals, especially pups, so I decided on [TheDogAPI](https://thedogapi.com/). PuppyLove is a simple site that allows a user to vote on random images of dogs, add and remove favorites, and seach by breed to see facts and more images.
